# Anifarm
NFT Defi Farming
    Anifarm.Finance is introducing a NFT Defi approach to staking and Yield Farming by introducing gamification theories to our NFTs and smart contract.

      Our Approach has gone beyond NFTs being just jpeg or stake NFTs to earn rewards to becoming smart assets that can perform multiple action and interact directly with our Staking platform, our gamification approach boasts a robust smart contract, keyword here being “Smart” Stakers Need to meet certain criterias for certain NFT perks to work, as some NFTs have single and others Multiple perks.

 Our Dapp is going to be built around this concept to support both Staking and Yield Farming Powered by our $Ani Tokens and NFTs, as we move forward we will incorporate other tokens and coins into our platform.


Project Highlight and Features:

Diverse Utility:
    In order to preserve the uniqueness of each NFT, different NFT have their own perks and boost, Anifarm will be using Farm Animals as the Theme for our NFT and each Animal family will offer Unique and some multi perks.

Stacking: 
     This Feature allows Users to stake more than 1 NFT since Different NFT gives different perks following the concept of gamification stacking different NFT can lead to different collective effect. 

+3% Capital Boost
+4% Reward Boost
-1%  Fee Reduced
-5% of Unstake Time Reduced

Governance: 
  Amidst all things we are community oriented as per the spirit of decentralization $Ani Token will be used for Staking as for governance we will be taking a unique approach to it, “PP” which stands for platform power, this is not a token but rather represents how much one interacts with our platform, PP is measured in points and can be directly measure as voting power, if you don't use the platform you should not participate in voting.
